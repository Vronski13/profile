      Hi, my name is Verena. I'm currently learning how to code with Le Wagon. Besides that I love food and exploring the world's beauty and diversity by traveling.

      <h3>Why I want to become a Full Stack Developer?</h3>
      <p>
      While working in Online Marketing I was always more interested in the technical & design parts of the job rather than the business parts. I was curious to understand how everything works and is connected in an App. Automation was an important topic in Online Marketing and I want to be able to understand the logic and in the end be able to do it myself!

      <h3>Cooking is like meditation!</h3>
      <p>
      Everyone loves food and there are sooo many good restaurants with all the world's tastes in Berlin. I love to explore all of them! But there's nothing better than a self-cooked meal with healthy and local incredients.

      <h3>Yoga and handball - sounds weird?</h3>
      <p>
      For me it's the perfect combination! Playing Handball for over 15 years makes you think you know your body, every muskle and what you're capable of. But then you do Yoga - and you finally explore your body. Get to the next level of your mind. I love the competition with handball - and to find my inner peace while practicing yoga :)
